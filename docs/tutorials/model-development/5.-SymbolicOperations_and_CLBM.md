# Symbolic Operations and CLBM

!!! warning "Before start, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with:"
		* Basic model creation in the TCLB code, see [first tutorial](/tutorials/model-development/1.-finite-difference-wave-equation)
    * Basics of LB physics, see [SRT LBM](/tutorials/model-development/2.-D2Q9-Single-Relexation-Time) and [DDF Heat Transfer](/tutorials/model-development/4.-D2Q9-HeatTransfer)

!!! success "We will cover following topics:"
    * Symbolic computations (within) TCLB.
    * Heat transfer on D2Q9 lattice using Central Moments (CM) a.k.a. Cascaded LBM.

## Notion of moments

The raw and central moments are introduced based on the work of Geier et al. \cite{Geier2006} as,

$$ k_{mn} = \sum_{\alpha}(e_{\alpha x})^m ( e_{\alpha y})^n \Psi_{\alpha} $$

while the central moments are calculated in a moving reference frame i.e., with respect to the fluid velocity:
$$ \tilde{k}_{mn} = \sum_{\alpha} ( e_{\alpha x} - u_x)^m ( e_{\alpha y} - u_y)^n \Psi_{\alpha} $$
