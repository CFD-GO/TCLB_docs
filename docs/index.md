The TCLB code is a parallel Lattice Boltzmann Method solver, able to run on multi-GPU
cluster architectures.

For a quick start, please refer to the [Getting Started
guide](/1.-getting-started/installation/).

Detailed descriptions of configuration of the code and compilation, can be
found in the "Installation" part of this manual. The "Running simulations"
part details the setup and execution of fluid flow simulations with TCLB.
The "Post-processing" details the way you can analyze the results. The
"Model development" part is a reference for developers wanting to add or
modify models in TCLB.

The "XML Reference" is an automaticaly generated reference of all
XML elements avaliable for usage in the TCLB configuration files. "Models"
is also automaticaly generated and is a reference of all models currently
avaliable, with all apropriate data for each of them.

Finnaly "Tutorials" section provides several step-by-step tutorials about
model development and other things.
