The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a widely used numerical scheme for solving both the Navier-Stokes
equation (NSE) and advection-diﬀusion problems.
Its popularity has signiﬁcantly risen in the recent three decades due to its ability to handle complex boundary shapes and its relative ease of implementation and parallelisation.
Further to this, its mesoscopic formulation allows physics to be introduced at a lower level than for example a ﬁnite-volume or ﬁnite-element discretisation of the governing equations may allow.

In this event we will show the state-of-the-art application of the LBM to the diffusion-reaction problems.
During the workshop a system of equations describing dynamics of the epidemic will be solved using LBM.
